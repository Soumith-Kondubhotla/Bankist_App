The Bankist App is a fictional, minimalist banking application that provides users with a realistic experience of managing accounts. It was developed as part of a JavaScript course and focuses on simulating key banking operations such as logging in, transferring money between accounts, requesting loans, and viewing transaction histories. The app is built using modern JavaScript techniques and styled with custom CSS for a clean and professional user interface.

Key Features:
1. Secure Login: Users can log in to their account using a secure pin system. The app provides a smooth user experience by displaying a personalized welcome message.
2. Transfers: Money can be transferred between accounts, with each transaction automatically updating the balance and reflecting on both the sender’s and receiver’s transaction histories.
3. Loan Requests: The app allows users to request loans, which are granted based on certain conditions, such as a minimum deposit requirement.
4. Transaction History: Users can view their transaction history, which is sorted by date and type (deposits and withdrawals). Dates are displayed in a user-friendly format, and amounts are shown in the user’s local currency.
5. Real-Time Balance & Summary: The app dynamically calculates and displays the user’s balance along with a summary of income, expenses, and interest earned.
6. Sorting & Timers: The transaction history can be sorted, and a logout timer ensures users are automatically logged out after a period of inactivity for security purposes.
